<p><b><center>NHL TOP 5 POWER RANKINGS</p></b></center>

<p>1. Blackhawks: The Blackhawks survived the circus trip going 3-3-1 and taking
3 out of 4 points in SoCal over the weekend without injured
captain Jonathan Toews. </p>
<p>2. Canadiens: Carey Price is leading this team and until he slows
down they'll continue to be towards the top of the list.</p>
<p>3. Rangers: The leagues highest scoring team in the NHL. Enough said. </p>
<p>4. Capitals: Their backup goalie has played insane, and 
has a .936 save percentage so far. </p>
<p>5. Penguins: Sidney Crosby continues to keep playing at a high level 
like he has all of his career.</p>
