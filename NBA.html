<p><b><center>PERSONALIZED TOP 5 POWER RANKINGS</center></b></p>

<p>1. Golden State Warriors: The Warriors have won 11 straight games
in a row and recorded 30-plus assists in 10 of them. They've moved
into second place in blocked shots and no. 7 in total
defense efficiency. </p>
<p>2. Cleveland Caveliers: The Cavs became the first team ever to sink
at least 20 3-pointers in consecutive games in wins over Dallas
and Portland. They're leaps and bounds better than any other team
in the East. Kyrie, Lebron, and Kevin Love combined for a mere 90 points
against the Philadelphia 76ers. </p>
<p>3. San Antonio Spurs: Just became the fifth team to go 10-0 
on the road and win all 10 by 5 or more points.
</p>
<p>4. LA Clippers: Clippers are a stud filled roster. Lost 2 
on their road trip but still have the third best record in the
western conference. Should finish top 3 in the conference at 
the end of the year, and give the warriors a run for their 
money. </p>
<p>5. Chicago Bulls: Jimmy Butler continues to play at an amazing
level, Rajon Rondo and Wade are also playing at a high level.
Expect them to be the only team to give Cleveland a challenge at the 
end of the year.p>
