<p><b><center>NFL TOP 5 POWER RANKINGS</center></b></p>

<p>1. Dallas Cowboys: The rookies are running the show. Cowboys 
have the strongest offensive line in football. </p>
<p>2.Patriots: In my eyes the New England Patriots are the best 
team in the AFC by far. Tom Brady is heads and tails
above any other quarterback in the NFL.   
<p>3. Raiders: The breakout of quarterback Derek Carr and wide 
recievers Amari Cooper have the Raiders the second best record 
in all of football. They also have a above average defense that 
definitely compliments the offense.</p>
<p>4. Seahawks: After the ugly lost to Tampa Bay they have moved
down a couple in my list.</p> 
<p>However, with the top defense 
in the league. 
</p>
<p>5. Giants: The Giants have been the sleeper team this
year because the </p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys have been so good.
OBJ has been on fire lately and the </p>
<p>defense has played really good.
